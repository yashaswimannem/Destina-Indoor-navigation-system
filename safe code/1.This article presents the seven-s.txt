1.This article presents the seven-step process involved in building a practical Wi-Fi-based indoor navigation system, which was implemented at the COEX complex in Seoul, Korea, in October 2010. The article describes the primary activities in each step using the COEX example. More than 200,000 users have downloaded the system since its first release. The successful launch of the COEX indoor navigation system suggests that indoor navigation is becoming a reality.
2.The indoor navigation is a system which is used to locate the exact locations inside a campus. This paper discusses about the navigation technology which uses the data stored in the active database of a University to locate the places which are requested, this system does not use the GPS (Global Positioning System) and any other Internettechnologies. Both the 2 -D (2-dimensional) and the 3-D (3-dimensional) navigations are possible in this system. The 2-dimensional navigation system uses the floor map of the campus and it directs the user with help of a route and in addition, the system guides with a path assistance mechanism. The graphical representations of the University buildings are used for 3-dimensional navigation which offers street view of the campus for the user to locate places. Indoor Navigation System.
3. Navigation System are very much essential for en-route assistance, indoor positioning etc. For outdoor environment navigation is still better as compared to complex indoor environment. In this research work, we have focused on building an indoor navigation application which uses augmented reality to assist people in navigating at complex buildings and also making a cloud platform (Content Management System) from where the administrator of a particular building can be able to modify and manage the navigation path. We have used Unity 3d framework to develop the AR based mobile application. The application can be run on smartphones. It has been seen that this augmented reality-based application provides better interface and experience than the traditional 2D maps or the paper maps that are displayed outside buildings to help in the navigation. To evaluate the concept proposed in the research, technical evaluations were performed at a hospital building.
4.Smartphone-based indoor navigation services are desperately needed in indoor environments. However, the adoption of them has been relatively slow, due to the lack of fine-grained and up-to-date indoor maps, or the potentially high deployment and maintenance cost of infrastructure-based indoor localization solutions. This work proposes ViNav, a scalable and cost-efficient system that implements indoor mapping, localization, and navigation based on visual and inertial sensor data collected from smartphones. ViNav applies structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques to reconstruct 3D models of indoor environments from crowdsourced images, locates points of interest (POI) in 3D models, and compiles navigation meshes for path finding. ViNav implements image-based localization that identifies users' positions and facing directions, and leverages this feature to calibrate dead-reckoning-based user trajectories and sensor fingerprints collected along the trajectories. The calibrated information is utilized for building more informative and accurate indoor maps, and lowering the response delay of localization requests. According to our experimental results in a university building and a supermarket, the system works properly and our indoor localization achieves competitive performance compared with traditional approaches: in a supermarket, ViNav locates users within 2 seconds, with a distance error less than 1 meter and a facing direction error less than 6 degrees.
5. GPS-based navigation technology has been widely used in most of the commercial navigation applications nowadays. However, its usage in indoor navigation is not as effective as when it is used at outdoor environment. Much research and developments of indoor navigation technology involve additional hardware installation which usually incur high setup cost. In this paper, research and comparisons were done to determine the appropriate techniques of indoor positioning, pathfinding, and route guidance for an indoor navigation method. The aim of this project is to present a simple and cost- effective indoor navigation system. The proposed system uses the existing built-in sensors embedded in most of the mobile devices to detect the user location, integrates with AR technology to provide user an immersive navigation experience. In this project, an indoor navigation mobile application was developed and tested. The development demonstrates the usage of IndoorAtlas which enables indoor positioning through technology fusion to detect user's position and obtain the route to destination, and ARCore to display AR guidance using the computed route. Surveys were carried out to gauge the efficiency of the method and to gather the feedback from the participants. The architecture of the method and the demonstration of the application is presented.
6.Dijkstra's algorithm (named after its discover, E.W. Dijkstra) solves the problem of finding the shortest path from a point in a graph (the source) to a destination. It turns out that one can find the shortest paths from a given source to all points in a graph in the same time, hence this problem is sometimes called the single-source shortest paths problem. This paper will help you understand the underlying concepts of Dijkstra Algorithm with the help of simple and easy to understand examples and illustrations.
7.Maps used in car navigation systems differ from indoor maps due to the fact that they were designed to address different needs. Therefore, map matching techniques used for outdoor navigation cannot be applied indoors without significant modifications. The main aim of this paper is to present modified map matching algorithm for special usage such as indoor navigation in shopping malls, hotels and airports. The research concentrates to improve accuracy of positioning engine and natural presentation of pedestrian trajectory. The article includes the indoor map matching algorithm proposals, with the highlights of their strengths and weaknesses.

Methodology
The development of the Indoor Navigation System for Sarath City Capital Mall follows a structured approach to ensure seamless navigation, accurate pathfinding, and an intuitive user experience. The methodology is divided into several key phases, from data collection and preprocessing to implementing the shortest path algorithm and real-time navigation assistance.

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
The first step in building the navigation system is gathering and structuring the mall layout data. The blueprint of the mall is analyzed to extract key elements such as store locations, corridors, escalators, stairs, and lifts. Since navigation should only occur along walkable paths, each store is mapped to its nearest corridor, ensuring that movement follows a logical and realistic route. This data is then structured in a JSON-based format, allowing the system to dynamically access store positions and paths.

2. Web Application Development
The navigation system is developed as a web-based application using React.js and React-Leaflet. The map of the mall is displayed as an interactive 2D layout, with stores and corridors plotted using the structured JSON data. Users can select their source and destination, and the system will compute the shortest path while avoiding walls and obstacles. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring visitors can interact with the map efficiently.

3. Implementation of the Shortest Path Algorithm
To determine the most efficient route between stores, the system utilizes Dijkstra’s Algorithm. The mall layout is represented as a graph, where stores and corridors are nodes, and walkable paths between them are edges with associated distances. When a user selects a source and destination, Dijkstra’s Algorithm calculates the shortest path dynamically, ensuring that navigation follows realistic walking routes instead of direct, unrealistic lines between stores. This prevents paths from cutting through walls and ensures visitors are guided along proper walkways.

4. Store and Corridor Mapping
To ensure that navigation follows walkable paths, stores are connected only to their nearest corridor points (such as mcX, lcX, rcX, dX). Corridors are then interconnected based on adjacency, preventing shortcuts through unconnected areas. This approach ensures that the system dynamically finds the best route while avoiding obstacles and maintaining a realistic indoor walking experience.

5. Multi-Floor Navigation
Since the mall consists of multiple floors, the navigation system incorporates floor transition points, such as escalators, stairs, and lifts. When a user selects a destination on a different floor, the system automatically includes the nearest transition point in the shortest path computation. This ensures that visitors are guided seamlessly between floors without confusion. The JSON dataset includes floor-specific store data, allowing the navigation system to differentiate between locations on different levels.

6. User Interaction and Real-Time Path Display
Once the shortest path is computed, the navigation path is visually displayed on the map. The path follows the corridors dynamically, guiding users through the correct routes. The map updates in real-time, ensuring a smooth and accurate user experience. The interface also allows for zooming and panning, making it easier for visitors to explore the mall layout and navigate efficiently.

Conclusion
The Indoor Navigation System is designed to enhance the overall shopping experience by providing an efficient and accurate wayfinding solution. By leveraging React.js, Leaflet.js, and Dijkstra’s Algorithm, the system ensures that users can navigate the mall effortlessly, following the shortest and most accessible routes. The methodology ensures that navigation is realistic, user-friendly, and scalable, making it a valuable tool for visitors to quickly find their way inside Sarath City Capital Mall.
